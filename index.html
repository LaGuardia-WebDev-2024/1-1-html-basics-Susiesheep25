  <h1> That Day </h1>
  
<p>
  That day was <em>bright</em> and so was I <br>
  The birds <em>chirped</em> and the wind blew by <br>
  the air smelled <em>fresh</em>, oh what a delight <br>
  That day was so great <br>
  That day was so nice <br>
  <strong>That day was so wonderful </strong><br>
  Oh my my <br>
  Oh when will that day come back
